          About Us
        </h1><br>
          Tactile graphics allow the visually impaired to perceive two-dimensional imagery, which is an essential part of learning science, geography, and other subjects. 
          <br><br>In the developed world, such graphics are available to blind students from an early age, and students grow up familiar with image representations. Tactile graphics, however, require special printers whose costs are often beyond resource-constrained institutions; thus, blind students in developing regions often grow up without any exposure to these learning aids. <br>
          <br>This application provides a software solution  for converting regular images into a form that can be printed as tactile imagery on relatively low-cost embossing device meant only for braille text.
          <br><br>Our goal is to see tactile images available to the visually impaired across all socio-economic backgrounds.
